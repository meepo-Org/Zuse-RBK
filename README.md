>  Greeno

## How to use the website
>  Greeno is a great optimal solution from two different sides:
1- it gives you the oppurtinity to contribute with your suggestion and idea about recycling so all people can use your knowledge in a good way 
2- you have the chance also to sell your extra items instead of throughing them out 
3- all the information in this app will be provided from people to people so don't worry all of them are practical. no theories here.
4- Greeno is extention for ReduceRuseRecycle project, so we added new feature to this project which are :-
  1- User has two options when wanna sign up 
    a- The first one is to regist as a normal user, so he can only see the stuff and take it as free or buy it.
    b- The seconed one is sign up as supplier, so he can add some stuff to sell it.
  2- we have two pages Paid-products and Free-products
  3- user can add his location and his product image  
  
## Legacy project
-the idea from this project, that we take from other group project and try to modify and add new feature to it.
